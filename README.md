# IoT-Based-Lighting-Control-Using-ESP32-with-MQTT-Communication

This project implements an IoT-based lighting control system using ESP32 microcontrollers, enabling remote management of individual lights, each controlled by a dedicated push button. Each light supports three states: 50% brightness, 100% brightness, and off.Â 
Communication between two ESP32 devices is facilitated using the MQTT protocol, ensuring efficient and reliable data transfer. The system consists of:
**Publisher ESP32:** Monitors the state of eight push buttons and transmits corresponding JSON-formatted messages to the MQTT broker.
**Subscriber ESP32:** Receives these messages, decodes the JSON data, and adjusts the brightness of the associated lights according to the specified state.
This design allows for seamless integration into IoT ecosystems, offering an intuitive and scalable solution for lighting control.

**Features**
- Dynamic Brightness Control: Adjust light brightness (50%, 100%, or off) with a single button press.
- Scalable and Modular Design: The system can be extended to control additional lights or devices.
- Efficient Communication: Uses MQTT for fast, reliable, and lightweight data transmission.
- JSON Message Format: Ensures structured and easily parseable data exchange.
- User-Friendly Interface: Physical push buttons for input, with visual feedback through lights.

**System Architecture**

The system architecture involves:
ESP32 Publisher: Reads button states and sends corresponding messages to the MQTT broker.
MQTT Broker: Handles message delivery between publisher and subscriber.
ESP32 Subscriber: Controls the brightness of lights based on received messages.

**Hardware Requirements**
- 2 x ESP32 boards
- 3 x Push Buttons
- 3 x LEDs or Light Bulbs (PWM-compatible for brightness control)
- Resistors (as needed for LED and button connections)
- Laptop with MQTT Broker
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

**Software Implementation**
The system consists of two main parts:
1. Publisher (Button Input)
The publisher reads the state of each push button, determines the light's next state (50%, 100%, or off), and sends this information as a JSON message via MQTT.
2. Subscriber (Light Control)
The subscriber receives JSON messages from the MQTT broker, parses the data, and adjusts the brightness of the corresponding light using PWM.
